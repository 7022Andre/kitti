# Kitti
A kids activity fun timer written in ReactJS.

## What is Kitti?

Kitti is an abbreviation for **Ki**ds Ac**t**ivi**t**y T**i**mer and also sounds like a small cat ... meow.

Kitti is an app that will help your child understand time by visualizing it rather than by just talking about it. You and your child choose a task, reward and activity and set the timer. A progress bar and countdown will visualize the remaining fun time. The basic idea is that the longer your child takes to complete a task the less fun time she/he will have.

## Artwork

All tasks were drawn and painted by my very talented wife. If you'd like to use them for your project please let me know.
