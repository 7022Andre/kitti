## What is Kitti?

Kitti is an abbreviation for **Ki**ds Ac**t**ivi**t**y T**i**mer and also sounds like a small cat ... meow.


Kitti is an app that will help your child understand time by visualizing it rather than by just talking about it. You and your child choose a task, reward and activity and set the timer. A progress bar and countdown will visualize the remaining fun time. The basic idea is that the longer your child takes to complete a task the less fun time she/he will have.
